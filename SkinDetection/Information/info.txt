Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin condition that causes inflammation, redness, itching, and sometimes swelling and oozing. It’s a common condition that can affect people of all ages, though it often begins in childhood. The exact cause of eczema isn't fully understood, but it’s believed to be linked to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including an overactive immune system, genetics, and irritants like soaps, perfumes, or certain fabrics. Stress and changes in weather can also trigger or worsen symptoms.

There are several types of eczema, each with slightly different symptoms:

Atopic Dermatitis: The most common form, often genetic and linked to other allergic conditions like asthma or hay fever.
Contact Dermatitis: Triggered by direct contact with an irritant or allergen.
Dyshidrotic Eczema: Causes small blisters on hands and feet.
Nummular Eczema: Characterized by coin-shaped spots on the skin.
Seborrheic Dermatitis: Often affects oily areas, like the scalp, face, and chest.
Symptoms
Itchy skin
Red or inflamed patches
Dry, cracked skin
Sometimes blisters or crusting
Treatment
While there is no cure, eczema can be managed. Treatments include moisturizers to keep skin hydrated, topical steroids to reduce inflammation, and medications or light therapy for more severe cases. Avoiding triggers, practicing good skin care, and managing stress can also help control symptoms.
