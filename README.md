# Personalized Skincare Recommendations powered by AI and Machine Learning
Create Personalized skincare recommendations powered by AI and Machine Learning based on consumer unique skin needs, and to equip beauty brands with a new way to enhance their customer experiences and drive sales and recommend tailored skincare solutions.

# Product Scope
●	Smart Camera Mode -   Capture Image and  provides feedback on factors like face positioning, angle, size, and lighting, optimizing the input for the AI. This ensures that the AI system receives the best possible images for analysis.
●	Analyze skin types and conditions.- identify patterns associated with different skin conditions. For example, the AI will learn what wrinkles look like across many different images and then be able to spot wrinkles in new, unlabeled images.
●	Analyze facial features such as wrinkles, pores, or signs of acne.
●	Create Skin scores and product recommendations to individuals

# Software Design Specification

1. Image Preparation: Just like a dermatologist might adjust lighting or ask to remove makeup before an examination, AI tools first prepare the selfie for analysis. This can involve adjusting for lighting variations or cropping the image to focus solely on the face.
2. Feature Extraction: With the image prepped, the algorithms get to work, acting like a dermatologist's magnifying glass. They examine the image, extracting key features that reveal insights about skin. These include:
Geometric Features: Platforms typically measure facial proportions, distances between key points (like eyes, nose, and mouth), and angles to assess facial structure and symmetry.
Textural Features: Algorithms analyze the patterns in skin texture to identify wrinkles, pores, and roughness.
Colorimetric Features: By analyzing the distribution of colors and their intensities, AI can assess skin tone, pigmentation, and the presence of redness or discoloration.
3. Machine Learning Models: The extracted features are then fed into machine learning models, which act as the AI's vast knowledge base. These models have been trained on extensive datasets of skin images and can typically identify skin type (oily, dry, etc.) and conditions like rosacea, predict skin age or wrinkle severity, and highlight specific areas like acne, pores, or dark spots.
4. Result Generation: Based on the analysis, the models generate a skin report – akin to a dermatologist's treatment plan. This report typically includes scores for different skin parameters, along with explanations and recommendations.
